# 16to8bit

Convert_16bit_to_8bit: using this you can convert numerous files in 16-bit format to 8-bit format. 
You will be asked to provide the folder where the tiff files are saved in and a destination folder to save the new files (old files will not be deleted).
â€¢	The new version is called 16to8bit. Script is the same, it is now skipping files that are not 16bit originally. Hence, if your folder includes files of 8bit and 16bit it will not convert the 8-bit files, only 16-bit.
